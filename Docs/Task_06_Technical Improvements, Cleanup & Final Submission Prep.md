# Task 06 – Technical Improvements, Cleanup & Final Submission Prep

## Objective

Enhance the project by addressing technical quality, build configuration, asset usage, and general performance best practices. Ensure the project is in a review-ready and build-ready state.

## Step-by-Step Summary

# 1. "Panel Refactor"

* Renamed `SettingsPopup` prefab to `GenericPanel`.
* Moved it to `0_Project/Shared/Prefabs` for shared use.
* Updated duplicated panels (ShopPanel, HomePanel, MapPanel) to reference this generic prefab.
* Renamed `SettingsPopupController` script to `GenericPopupController`.
* Moved the script to `0_Project/Shared/Scripts`.

# 2. "Animation & Memory Cleanup"

* Added `transform.DOKill();` to `OnDisable()` in `GenericPopupController.cs` to prevent tween memory leaks.
* Popup transitions verified using DOTween.
* Animator uses "Close" trigger to deactivate panels after animation.

```csharp
void OnDisable()
{
    transform.DOKill(); // Prevent memory leak from hanging tweens
}
```

# 3. "DOTween Settings Review"

* Safe Mode: ✅ Enabled
