# Task 04 – Leadership & Communication Feedback

# Overview
As a Lead Technical Artist, my role extends beyond implementation.
I proactively foster collaboration between art, design, and engineering to align pipelines, optimize creative intent, and raise the technical quality bar.

The feedback below addresses how I would lead, communicate, and support the team based on the test project structure, visual quality, and engineering constraints.

---
## Review Process and Communication Style
# Feedback Culture
- I maintain an "open feedback loop", where artists and engineers can discuss implementation trade-offs without judgment.
- My reviews focus on "clarity, impact, and solutions". When reviewing a system, I annotate shortcomings but always provide a fix or fallback approach.

## Workflow and Handoff
- I prefer "documented standards" (naming, folder hierarchy, prefabs, materials).
- When onboarding junior artists, I often create "example scenes and debug views".
- I use Git commit history to illustrate decision logic, helping others understand technical reasoning over time.

---
## Working Across Teams
# With Artists:
- I often build "validation tools" (e.g., texel density checker, material verifier).
- For the test project, I would advise UI artists to use consistent pivot points, anchoring presets, and font rendering settings.

# With Designers:
- I propose using ScriptableObjects for UI state transitions (e.g., bottom nav config), reducing manual setup.
- I work with designers early on to ensure tech constraints (like draw calls and batching) are understood without breaking creative flow.

# With Engineers:
- I define interface contracts and lightweight communication models (e.g., UnityEvent, event buses).
- I collaborate on shared services like a `UIFlowManager` or state router to simplify logic in controller scripts.

## Leadership Actions I Would Take on This Project

| Area | Action |
|------|--------|
| UI System | Introduce `BaseUIController.cs` to unify init/destroy logic |
| Workflow | Setup Unity Editor tools to auto-validate sprite import settings |
| Communication | Provide a `README.md` for each module with responsibilities and authoring tips |
| Visual Feedback | Implement animation states for nav selection (active/inactive) with DOTween |
| Onboarding | Build a “UI Debug HUD” to inspect current screen/module states in play mode |

# Summary
Technical leadership is not just about solving problems but "anticipating them" — empowering teams to work efficiently while preserving creativity.
My goal is to streamline collaboration, maintain visual quality, and lead by example with clear feedback, reusable tools, and scalable solutions.
