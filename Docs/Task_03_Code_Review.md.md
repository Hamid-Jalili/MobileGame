# Task 03 – Code Review & Architecture Feedback

# Overview
The codebase contains lightweight UI controller scripts and utility logic primarily housed under:

- `Assets/0_Project/Modules/HomeScreen/Footer/Scripts/`
- `Assets/0_Project/Modules/SettingsPopup/`
- `Assets/0_Project/Modules/LevelCompletedScreen/`
- `Assets/0_Project/Shared/`

A total of 8 scripts were found. These are simple and functional but exhibit inconsistencies and architectural limitations that would not scale well in a production mobile game.

## Structure Observations
# Strengths:
- Code is logically grouped by feature folder (`HomeScreen`, `SettingsPopup`, etc.).
- Each screen/module has its own controller script, making onboarding easier.
- Class names follow expected C# naming conventions (`SettingsPopupController`, `MenuFooterController`).

# Issues:
- No use of namespaces or assemblies — which increases the risk of name collisions.
- No common base class or shared interface across UI controllers.
- Utility classes (e.g., `CameraResolutionCheck.cs`, `SafeArea.cs`) live in the same space as feature modules.
- Some scripts include redundant logic (`Start()` method setting active states that could be set in Editor).

# Suggested Improvements:
- Introduce namespaces by feature (e.g., `Tripledot.UI.Settings`, `Tripledot.Common`).
- Use shared base classes (e.g., `UIScreenController`) with virtual lifecycle hooks.
- Move general-purpose scripts (`SafeArea`, `CameraResolutionCheck`) into a `Shared/Scripts/` folder and mark them with `[ExecuteAlways]` if needed in editor.
- Establish naming rules for new modules (e.g., `FeatureName_ModuleName_Controller.cs`).

## Coding Standards & Practices
# Observed:
- No visible use of logging, null guards, or debug assertions.
- Inconsistent use of `SerializeField`, `private`, `public`, and field naming.
- No code comments or summaries for public methods.
- No separation between logic and view in UI interaction scripts.

# Recommended:
- Apply consistent visibility (`private` + `[SerializeField]`).
- Use comments for public-facing APIs or complex UI interactions.
- Consider using UnityEvents or interfaces for navigation logic decoupling.
- Where applicable, introduce `ScriptableObject`-based configuration over hardcoded state.

---
## Architecture & Scalability
# Observed:
- Tight coupling of logic to GameObjects (`.SetActive()` toggles directly in scripts).
- No reactive patterns or data binding — UI must be refreshed manually.
- Lack of a central UI manager, scene controller, or state machine to govern flow.
- MonoBehaviours are overused for 1–2 line functions that could be static methods or data classes.

# Recommended:
- Add a `UIFlowManager` or `SceneRouter.cs` to manage screen-to-screen transitions.
- Adopt a hybrid reactive/data-driven UI approach using:
  - `ScriptableObject` singletons
  - Signals / Event channels
  - Serialized UI model configs

---
# Summary
The code is well-intentioned and clean for a test project but not yet production-grade.  
Its simplicity makes onboarding fast, but improvements to modularity, naming, decoupling, and code consistency will better prepare it for scale.
